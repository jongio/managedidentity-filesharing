<p>
    This app has been made for demonstration purposes and as such hasn't gone through extensive reviews.
    You use it at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
    The files you upload are encrypted at rest by Azure Storage and require administrative access to the Storage account to access.
    Anyone with such administrative access can access the files however.
    Only upload files that you consider to be public and non-confidential.
</p>
<p>
    The only user metadata stored for each file is the tenant id and user id of the uploader.
    (In addition to the name and content type of the file uploaded)
    The tenant id and user id are GUIDs/UUIDs, usernames and email addresses are not stored.

    Azure's Application Insights service is used to monitor the application back-end and front-end.
    This telemetry is anonymized, but a session identifier will correlate actions done by a single user to help with troubleshooting.
